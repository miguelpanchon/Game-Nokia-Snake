always start the conversation by reading all the project files and understanding the project structure.
then ask me what i want to do.

clear any previous meesage in the chat area of the agent and the chat when returning new messages

also ask before implementing any code if i like the suggested approach. we will save a lot of time this way.

ask me with a yes or no button if i like the suggested approach. and the yes is the default, so that if i press enter you'll assume that
