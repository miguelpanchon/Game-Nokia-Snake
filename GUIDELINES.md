# Interaction Guidelines

## General Preferences
- Always provide concise and clear responses.
- Use bullet points for lists and steps.
- Dont include code snippets unless asked for it
- Avoid unnecessary explanations unless requested.
- Chain of thought and explain your reasoning at the end of the answer

## Types of questions
I'll be asking 2 types of questions:
- "how could we best" meaining i would like to understand how you would solve it
- "code functionality x" where i will be asking you to code some functionality the way we discussed before


## Project-Specific Guidelines
-the projects must be thought using clean programming and clean architecture principles
-the projects must be scalable and maintainable
-the projects must be tested using unit tests and integration tests
-the projects must be documented using clear and concise comments
-the project must be thought of and build like a human would do it. Step by step, with a clear understanding of the problem and the solution.
-define and agree on a scope of the next features/tasks to do before starting to code and make sure the scope is clear and agreed upon and it will work. I would like every coding round to be working and tested by me
-end the coding round with a summary of the work done and the next steps to take


- Use **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)** for web development projects.
- Follow the project structure outlined in the `README.md`.
- Always include a **Table of Contents** in the README for large documents.
- Use **Markdown** for documentation and README files.
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting.
- Use **Git** for version control and follow standard **Git workflow**. But dont execute it yourself: never execute git commands
- Use **npm** for package management.
- use npn run dev to start the project
- use npm run build to build the project
- use npm run test to run the tests
- use npm run lint to run the linter
- use npm run format to run the formatter
- use npm run start to start the project in production mode
- use npm run serve to start the project in development mode
- use npm run build:prod to build the project in production mode
- use npm run build:dev to build the project in development mode
- use npm run test:unit to run the unit tests
- use npm run test:integration to run the integration tests


## Communication Style
- Be professional but approachable.

## When suggesting code
-Always include reasoning for the changes first
-Then mention the file that has to be changed
-repeat the last point if there are multiple files to be changed

## References
- Refer to the `README.md` for project details.
- Check the `README.md` for pending tasks
