*1997: Nokia 6110 launched with the original Snake game.
*1998: Nokia continued to include Snake in other models, such as the Nokia 5110, which also became very popular.
*2000s: Variations of Snake (like Snake II) were included in many Nokia phones, such as the Nokia 3310 (released in 2000), which is one of the most famous phones to feature the game.
