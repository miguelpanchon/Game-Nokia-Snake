# Sound Management in the Game

## Overview
This document outlines the sound management features implemented in the game, including how sounds behave during gameplay, pauses, and game over states.

## Sound Features
1. **Gameplay Sound**: 
   - The gameplay sound plays continuously while the game is active and will loop until the game is over or paused.
   - The sound will stop immediately when the game is paused.
   - The gameplay sound will stop before the game over sound plays.


2. **Game Over Sound**:
   - When game over occurs, the gameplay sound is stopped
   - The game over sound plays when the game ends.
   - The sound will fade out gradually over 10 seconds.
   - The volume of the game over sound resets for the next game.

## Implementation Details
- The game over sound is managed using a volume control mechanism that decreases the volume in intervals.
- The gameplay sound is paused immediately when the game enters the game over state to prevent overlapping sounds.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding options for users to toggle sound effects on or off.
- Explore additional sound effects for different game events (e.g., power-ups, obstacles).
